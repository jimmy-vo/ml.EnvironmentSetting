This is a guide to setup Data Science workspace Keras, GPU on Linux and Window machine.

## Target
+ Have a working environment with Container - Docker or Anaconda
+ Build a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model
+ Auto generate CNNs and fine tune

## Setup Environment
Below is two option
+ Window Environment ([Link](Window10-GPU-Anaconda-Jupyter.md)). It includes:
    + Install and setup CUDA and cuDNN
    + Install Anaconda and manage environments
    + Install Jupyter Notebook and verify environment
+ Ubuntu Environment:
    + Install and setup CUDA and cuDNN
    + Setup environment:
        + Docker (Recommend)
        + Install Anaconda (optional)     
    + Install Jupyter Notebook and verify environment
    + Setup Back-end Automation scripts
